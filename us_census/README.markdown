# US Census (by state) Demo Description & Instructions


## Context of the Demo

__Industry:__ Financial Services, Government, Healthcare, Insurance, Media, Retail, Telecommunications, and any other industry that utilizes demographic data

__Use case:__ Predicting home ownership by demographics

__Explanation:__ The data is brought into the workflow for exploratory analysis and linear regression. Variables are created and removed from the data. Then a linear regression is conducted on the transformed data to predict home ownership.



## Using the Demo

__Major Components of the demo__

* _Data:_ State level demographic information from the US Census
* _Transformation:_ Select subset of variables and create new variables

__Key Points__

* The Bar Chart, Frequency, Histogram, Scatter Plot Matrix, and Summary Statistics operators are used to investigate the data
* The Variable operators selects a subset of 7 variables from the existing data and adds a total of 6 new variables that the following operators will run on
* The Aggreation operator performs summation of 4 variables at the sub-region level
* The Linear Regression operator models an equation that predicts home ownership (R2: 0.3737, Standard Error: 0.0433)

__Operators__

* _Data Selection and Trasnformation (Variable Operator):_ Computes the summary statistics (variable name, data type, count, number of unique values, number of null values, number of empty, number of zero, min value, 25% quartile, median, 75% quartile, max value, standard deviation, average, number of positive values, number of negative values, the 10 most common values) for all columns in the data.
* _Summary Statistics (Full):_ Computes the summary statistics (variable name, data type, count, number of unique values, number of null values, number of empty, number of zero, min value, 25% quartile, median, 75% quartile, max value, standard deviation, average, number of positive values, number of negative values, the 10 most common values) for all columns.
* _Scatter Plot Matrix:_ Visualizes the scatter plot matrix and computes correlation between 7 columns (datum_WHITE, datum_BLACK, datum_HISPANIC, datum_MALES, datum_MED_AGE, datum_AVE_HH_SZ, datum_AVE_FAM_SZ).
* _Histogram:_ Visualizes histogram for 3 columns (datum_POP2000, datum_AVE_HH_SZ, datum_WHITE) using different number of bins for each column (10 bins, 5 bins, 10 bins).
* _Bar Chart:_ Visualizes a bar chart of the sum of the value of datum_HISPANIC in each value in datum_SUB_REGION (E N Cen, E S Cen, Mid Atl, Mtn, N Eng, Pacific, S Atl, W N Cen, W S Cen).
* _Frequency:_ Computes the frequency of each value in datum_SUB_REGION (E N Cen, E S Cen, Mid Atl, Mtn, N Eng, Pacific, S Atl, W N Cen, W S Cen) and displays it as a bar chart and as a data spreadsheet view.
* _Data Selection and Transformation (Variable Operator):_ Selects subset of 7 columns (datum_SUB_REGION, datum_AREA, datum_POP2000, datum_WHITE, datum_BLACK, datum_AGE_65_UP, datum_OWNER_OCC) from the census data.Transforms 4 of the selected columns (datum_WHITE, datum_BLACK, datum_OWNER_OCC, datum_AGE65_UP) into percentages using pig expressions. Renames transformed columns (pct_white, pct_black, pct_owner_occ, pct_old).
* _Summary Statistics (Transformed):_ Computes the summary statistics (variable name, data type, count, number of unique values, number of null values, number of empty, number of zero, min value, 25% quartile, median, 75% quartile, max value, standard deviation, average, number of positive values, number of negative values, the 10 most common values) for all 11 columns from the Data Selection and Transformation operator (pct_white, pct_black, pct_owner_occ, pct_old, datum_SUB_REGION, datum_AREA, datum_POP2000, datum_WHITE, datum_BLACK, datum_AGE_65_UP, datum_OWNER_OCC).
* _Summation (Aggregation Operator):_ For each subregion represented in the datum_SUB_REGION column, computes total count of white population (SUM_datum_WHITE), total count of black population (SUM_datum_BLACK), total area of the subregion (SUM_datum_AREA), and total population of the subregion (SUM_datum_POP2000) using new columns that were created in the "Data Selection and Transformation" step above.
* _Sub-region Percentages (Variable Operator):_ Calculates the percentage of white (pct_white_sr_avg) and (pct_black_sr_avg) population in each sub-region.
* _Linear Regression:_ Linear regression with pct_owner_occ as dependent variable and pct_white, pct_black, and pct_old as regressors. Provides the linear regression equation, R-squared value, and standard error in the "Summary" results tab. Provides the coefficient value, standard error, t-statistic, and p-value of the intercept and 3 regressor variables in the "Data" results tab. Visualizes a residual plot in the "Residual Plot" results tab. Visualizes a Q-Q plot in the "Q-Q Plot" results tab.
