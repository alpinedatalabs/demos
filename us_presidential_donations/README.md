# Presidential Donations Demo Description & Instructions


## Context of the Demo

__Industry:__ Government, Politics 

__Use case:__ Comparing presidential donations to Barack Obama and Mitt Romney during the 2012 presidential election

__Explanation:__ The data is brought into the workflow for data transformation (add variables, filter rows, and aggregate into bins). Then, the donations of two candidates are compared using bar charts.


## Using the Demo

__Major Components of the demo__

* _Data:_ [Donation data] (http://www.fec.gov/disclosurep/pnational.do?cf=phome) for the 2012 US presidential election 
* _Transformation:_ Select a subset of variables, add new variables, and filter rows.

__Key Points__

* The Variable, Row Filter, and Aggregation operators are used to transform the data
* The Scatter Plot Matrix, Frequency, and Bar Chart operators are used to investigate the data 

__Operators__

* _LOG(contb_amt):_ Selects a subset of 5 variables (cand_id, cand_nm, contbr_st, contb_receipt_amt, contb_receipt_dt). Applies a logarithmic transformation to the contb_receipt_amt variable in order to account for skewness of the variable. By rounding these values, this can be treated as a binning process. Extracts the last name of the candidates.
* _obama or romney:_ Filters the rows so that the output data is representative of only Obama (cand_id = P80003338) and Romney (cand_id = P80003353).
* _Binning:_ Computes the number of donation instances, the largest donation, the average donation, and the sum of all donations for each donation amount bin and for both Obama and Romney.
* _Contribution Comparison (count):_ Visualizes a bar chart of the number of donation instances in each donation amount bin for both Obama and Romney.
* _Contribution Comparison (sum amt):_ Visualizes a bar chart of the total amount of donations in each donation amount bin for both Obama and Romney.

__Demo Tips__

* Show the demo in Chrome or Firefox
* Run the demo before you show it live and use Actions\My Flow Results to display the outputs of the analytic flow
